# SegDecon
AI-powered nuclei segmentation enhances histological image process and Spatial Transcriptomics deconvolution
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables spatially resolved gene expression profiling but is often limited by low resolution. To address this, we introduce SegDecon, an AI-powered pipeline that enhances tissue segmentation using histology color data and refines cell-type estimates with cell count-informed deconvolution. Validated on high-resolution datasets, SegDecon outperforms existing methods and is available at . Beyond deconvolution, it supports broader applications in nuclei and cell segmentation-based analyses.
